Atomchain Federated Hybrid Peer-to-Peer(AtomP2P) Architecture
document 
Because of how novel, disruptive, groundbreaking, 
and masterful the AtomP2P is over the existing P2P topology employed by major blockchains, 
I thought it essential not to expose the technologies and ideas directly to the public, 
because of theft and obvious security reasons.
