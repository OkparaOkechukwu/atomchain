Abstract:   
We propose an alternative technology to blockchain, called the atomchain, which aims to eliminate the multiple spending of coins problem, 51% attack, Race attack and Finney attack. The network has a secure way of keeping the sequence of transactions when new entries are added. The network timestamps transactions using a double-hashing encapsulation technique (involving Merkle Root and Atom Root), then links the messages to the last valid atom, called the atomsphere, which is broadcasted to nodes base on their elevation modes and pools. Atomchain is perceived to be more efficient than blockchain by design; for instance, the energy and resources that are spent as a result of “forks” in blockchain; either does not exist or is absorbed by this new alternative.
