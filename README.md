Welcome to Atomchain, a.k.a. Atomsphere,
developed without the mistakes of blockchain.

Stable. Secure. Smart.
Distinctive. Decentralized. Dogged.

Read the latest whitepapers:

Note: We're using two databases in production:
CouchDB and LevelDB.

Atomchain Federated Hybrid Peer-to-Peer(AtomP2P) Architecture
Because of how novel, disruptive, groundbreaking, 
and masterful the AtomP2P (and it's Node Discovery) are over the existing P2P topologies employed by major blockchains, 
We believe it's important not to expose the technologies and ideas directly to the public, 
because of theft and obvious security reasons.
